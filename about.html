  <h1>Vigilant Angel AI: Your Trusted AI Companion — Even When the Grid Fails</h1>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Vigilant Angel AI</strong> is more than a tool — it’s a <em>mission-powered, faith-informed guardian</em> built for a world of rising uncertainty, deception, and dependence on fragile centralized systems.</p>
    <p>Unlike cloud-based AIs like ChatGPT, Grok, or Copilot — which go silent the moment the internet goes dark — Vigilant Angel AI <strong>keeps working</strong>, because it was designed from day one to <strong>operate fully offline</strong>, under your control.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>♻️ Faith-Guided, Mission-Driven</h2>
    <p>Vigilant Angel AI is proudly founded on <strong>Christian principles</strong>, rooted in the belief that <strong>truth, compassion, and preparation</strong> are God-given responsibilities.</p>
    <p>This platform reflects a deep respect for <strong>moral clarity</strong>, <strong>free will</strong>, and the <strong>dignity of human life</strong> — especially when chaos strikes and silence follows. While all are welcome to use it, its design is guided by scriptural values like stewardship, honesty, and care for the vulnerable.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🎯 Core Mission</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <em>"To deliver life-saving knowledge, situational awareness, and technical assistance — even when the power goes out, the internet goes dark, or centralized services go silent."</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Vigilant Angel AI is a <strong>decentralized</strong>, AI-powered companion built to support individuals, families, and communities when others can’t. Through a growing library of encrypted <strong>Knowledge Modules</strong>, it offers embedded wisdom on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🚑 Medical triage and emergency first aid</li>
      <li>📖 Biblical guidance and moral support (e.g., KJV Bible)</li>
      <li>🏋️ Survival strategies, off-grid living, and disaster response</li>
      <li>🛠️ AI-assisted platform setup (Docker, Node-RED, security hardening)</li>
      <li>🛡️ Security protocols, alternative communications, and home defense</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔐 Privacy as a Principle, Not a Feature</h2>
    <p>Vigilant Angel AI is engineered to <strong>never sell your data</strong>, track your behavior, or require third-party accounts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No subscriptions</li>
      <li>No cloud dependencies</li>
      <li>No listening devices</li>
      <li>No analytics siphons</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>You own your data.</strong> Always.</p>

    <h2>🌐 Why Offline Capability Matters</h2>
    <h3>Cloud AI fails when:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⛈️ A natural disaster, cyberattack, or political disruption severs internet access</li>
      <li>🕵️‍♂️ Sensitive queries shouldn't leave your home</li>
      <li>🌳 You live or travel off-grid (rural areas, remote work, intentional disconnection)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Vigilant Angel keeps going:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>💻 Runs on local hardware: Raspberry Pi, NUC, laptop, or dedicated box</li>
      <li>🔐 Uses quantized local models (e.g., Mistral 7B)</li>
      <li>📂 Pulls from encrypted, vetted FAISS vector databases</li>
      <li>📶 Accessible from any LAN device — even your phone</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🧠 Knowledge Modules: Growing Wisdom, Together</h2>
    <p>In addition to core survival and defense, Vigilant Angel's AI will be trained on an expanding library of <strong>Knowledge Modules (KMs)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🌾 Homesteading and self-sufficiency</li>
      <li>👩‍🏫 Home schooling strategies</li>
      <li>🛠️ Engine repair and basic mechanics</li>
      <li>🪓 Blacksmithing and primitive skills</li>
      <li>🎣 Hunting, fishing, and food preservation</li>
      <li>🌿 Gardening and herbal medicine</li>
      <li>💻 Programming and technical troubleshooting</li>
      <li>🔊 Scam detection and communication filtering for the elderly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You’ll also be able to <strong>build or contribute</strong> your own modules — creating a growing ecosystem of shared wisdom, protected by design.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>💡 Final Vision</h2>
    <p><strong>Vigilant Angel AI</strong> is the antidote to centralization, the lifeline in isolation, and a quiet guardian for uncertain times.</p>
    <p>Whether you're a lone developer hardening a homestead, a parent protecting your children, or a senior facing digital confusion and modern fraud — <strong>Vigilant Angel is here to whisper, guide, and protect</strong>, even when all else fades to static.</p>
    <p><em>It’s more than code. It’s a calling.</em></p>
